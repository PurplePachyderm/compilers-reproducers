FOR NVIDIA GPU (NVHPC 22.9/ A100):


Compile the lib and program:

Compile object file:

 nvc -mp -target=gpu -gpu=cc80 -fPIC -g -c libWithOpenMP.c

For shared:

	Compile the lib:

	nvc -mp -target=gpu -gpu=cc80 -fPIC -g -c -shared src/libWithOpenMP.c -o libtest.so

	Compile test.c:

	nvc -mp -target=gpu -gpu=cc80 -g  -L./lib -ltest test.c

For static:

	Compile the lib

	ar r libtest.a src/libWithOpenMP.o

	Compile test.c

	nvc -mp -target=gpu -gpu=cc80 -g test.c  ./lib/libtest.a




1.

Result:

	nvidia can't create bitcode for the GPU and crash at the JIT compilation for the GPU.

	The result is for version > 22.9:

	Accelerator Fatal Error: Failed to find device function 'nvkernel_checkAcces_F1L29_2'! File was compiled with: -gpu=cc80
	Rebuild this file with -gpu=cc80 to use NVIDIA Tesla GPU 0
 	 File: omp.c
	 Function: __nvomp_omp_target_alloc
	 Line: 940

	For lower version of NVHPC it just result to an error: CUBIN not found, when it want to execute function that the compiler failed to compile for the GPU. 

	With the static lib we don't have any issue with that.
